      <strong class="btn btn-primary">About Me</strong> 
      <p></p>
      <p>I am a seasoned Ruby on Rails developer with an extensive background in web development. I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from RTM Nagpur University.Building, creating and programming has always been a passion of mine and I am now pursuing it further at California State University, Fullerton, where I am a graduate student in their Masters of Computer Science program.My goal is to become a part of a company whose passion and hunger for innovation and technology matches my own. I consider myself a very detailed-oriented person who does not commence any task without understanding the requirements fully to avoid rework. I am interested in education, healthcare and marketing domain.</p>
      <p>
      I sometimes practise coding on <a href="http://geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">geeksforgeeks</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">leetcode</a> <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">codewars</a>, <a href="https://codefights.com/" target="_blank">codefights</a> and <a href="https://hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">hackerrank</a>. I like to read other people's solutions on these websites to get more ideas that how to solve the same problem in multiple ways using different programming languages.</p>
      <p>I also like to cultivate new hobbies and try new things. Recently, I started reading blogs particularly health and tech blogs, cooking and practicing meditation. I am a highly social person and active on social media. I find <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">twitter</a> useful for making online complaints and I really use twitter for that. I wish sometimes that our life should also be like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank">version control system</a> where we can go to the previous good commit or reset bad commit in our life..:)
